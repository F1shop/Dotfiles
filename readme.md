This is a minimal rice for productivity.

Please note: this easy installation deletes the i3 configuration file. If you wish to keep your i3 configuration file, save it in a directory other than .config.

If you want to use it for productivity or as a base for your rice :
(On Arch)

sudo pacman -S git

cd .config

git clone https://github.com/F1shop/Dotfiles

cd Dotfiles

chmod +x install.sh

./install.sh

#if the install.sh don't work then copy and paste it in your terminal

reboot

(to have polybar)

You can check in the i3 config file for shortcuts.
